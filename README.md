hello world

I'm currently learning python. trying to utilize this program for data analytics or try to become python dev , I've been teaching myself because I feel like open source is better than throwing money onto some piece of paper. if anyone wants to share your experience I'm always wanting to hear from someone who share same similarities, I'm not proficient yet , still on basics on syntax and libraries but excited to start this journey and who ever I come across
